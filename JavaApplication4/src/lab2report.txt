Write a one paragraph description of the assignment that includes the following:
 • What was the problem you were tasked with solving?
 • How did you go about solving the problem? 
• What is an API and how useful was it in completing this assignment?

The lab objective is to write a Java program that takes Fahrenheit degrees  from the user and converts it to a celsius degree. My approach focused on  storing  the Fahrenheit
temperature in the F variable using the Scanner object, then storing the converted value  in a new double value named C. To take the input from the user I imported  
the Scanner object. For the rounding, I used Math.round to round the number by multiplying it by 10.0, then divide it by 10.0 to get one digit after the decimal. 
Application programming interface (API) is a set of predefined rules and specifications. It was useful in this project because accessing Oracle API allowed me to 
learn more about Scanner class and Math class to use them effectively without the need to fully understand how they work.




 What does the pseudo-code for this assignment look like?
Main ()
{
	Print (“Enter a Fahrenheit degree”);
double f = Math.round((Input.nextDouble()*10.0))/10.0;
double c= (f-32)*5/9;
	c= Math.round(c*10.0)/10.0;   
	Print (Your degree in Fehrenhite is "+f);
	Print (Your degree in Celsius  is "+c);
}

• . What is the return type of the format method for a DecimalFormat object?
Formats a double to produce a string 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html
• What is the error that gets thrown from the Type Conversion section of this handout? 
When declaring a double value to format method , because the format method doesn't return a double.
• Describe what “#,##0.0” does when used as a parameter for DecimalFormat. 
In the expression “#,##0.0” the #tills us to print a digit if provided, or nothing otherwise. The 0 tills us to print a digit if provided or 0 if otherwise.
Providing this information,  we are tilling DecimalFormat  to print two zeros after and before the decimal.
